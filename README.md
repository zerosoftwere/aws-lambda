# Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Application, backed by DynamoDB database, email subscription notification with AWS SNS, periodically send email with AWS Event Bridge and Sendgrid, running on AWS Lambda using the traditional Serverless Framework.

## Usage

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

✔ Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev (196s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-dynamodb-api-project-dev-api (766 kB)
```
